### Challenge: "Trust" for work colleagues in anonymous economies
- Trust is essential when requesting work in DAOs.
  - Does the person have the necessary skills to complete the task?
  - Can the person commit to a specific timeframe? etc.
- Currently, there are only two ways to determine someone's trustworthiness:
  - ① Confirming a team member's activities and evaluations from previous projects
  - ② Trusting the self-reported achievements and work products of the other person.
- Method ① only applies to people within one's immediate circle, and method ② does not provide objective and reliable information.

### Solution: A decentralized member evaluation system
- A teammate of a user writes an evaluation.
- The contents of the evaluation are encrypted and stored.
- To confirm the evaluation, one can purchase a unique token and send it to the user's wallet, which allows the evaluation to be decrypted and viewed.
- Those who disclose evaluations can return the tokens they receive to the community or the evaluator as a creator fee (similar to NFT creator fees).

### Vision: A world where trust can be exchanged without trust
- A mechanism for transferring people's evaluations as "reliable information from a third party."
  - The person who wrote the evaluation is disclosed before purchase.
  - The specific contents of the evaluation and the evaluator are not linked (=who entered which evaluation remains unknown until the end).
- By collecting fair evaluations from work partners, a world where DAOs and project launches can judge "Who should we entrust with this work?" fairly can be realized.
  - Leaves no room for false self-reports.
  - A departure from the "honest person loses" world.
